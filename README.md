# Cryo-EM data processing tools for deep learning (e.g., cryo-IEF)

This repository contains tools for processing cryo-EM data, particularly for training deep learning models like
cryo-IEF. The tools are designed to handle various tasks such as data augmentation, normalization, and preparation of
datasets for training. For more details on implementation and usage, refer to
the [cryo-IEF repository](https://github.com/westlake-repl/Cryo-IEF).
